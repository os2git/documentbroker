In the following, we assume that you wish to set up the document broker and the
template system as two distinct services on the same server. It is also
possible and in some configurations recommended to install them on different
servers.

REQUIREMENTS
============

In order to proceed, the following Debian packages or their equivalents in
other operating systems MUST be installed on your system:

    postgresql
    python-virtualenv
    postgresql-server-dev-all
    python-dev
    apache2
    libapache2-mod-wsgi

If using the built-in Photologue image storage in the template server, these
packages are also necessary:

    libjpeg8
    libjpeg8-dev

Please note that after installation you MUST ensure that the Python Imaging
Library is compiled with JPEG support. See this forum article for details:

INSTRUCTIONS
============

After unpacking or cloning from a git repository, cd into 
this directory and execute the command

./create_virtualenv

This will create the virtual Python environment and install Django and all
necessary Python packages. 

Next, to set up the Apache server, soft link the sample configuration file into
the Apache sites dir:

cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
sudo ln -s <path-to-installation>/document_broker/etc/document_broker.apache.conf ./document_broker
sudo ln -s
<path-to-installation>/document_templates/etc/document_templates.apache.conf ./document_templates

NOTE: The Apache configuration files currently contain hard coded paths etc.
which may not correspond to the realities of your site. 

Once you have ensured the paths are correct, you may execute 

sudo a2ensite document_broker
sudo a2ensite document_templates

to enable the sites and

sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart 

to enable the service.


DATABASE INSTRUCTIONS
=====================

(For document_broker - modify and repeat for the template system.)

Set up the database server of your choice and fix the DB settings in
<path-to-installation>/document_broker/document_broker accordingly.

To create a PostgreSQL database (recommended), do:

    ~/>sudo su - postgres

    postgres=# createdb document_broker
    postgres=# createuser document_broker
    postgres=# psql -c "grant all on database document_broker to document_broker" 

Navigate to <path-to-installation>/document_broker and execute the command

python manage.py syncdb

You can now start setting up the metadata through the admin system.
