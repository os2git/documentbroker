This library contains utility functions with are not Django-aware, i.e. for
general use. This library belongs to the layer BELOW Django, so NO Django stuff
may be imported here. 

Some of this may have to be shared between the document broker and the template
system, and in that case, it will be moved to the  /lib/ folder in the
virtualenv.
