    <h1>Sample text from Henry Fielding's <cite>Tom Jones</cite></h1>
    <p>Here's a short excerpt from a great 18th Century British 
      novel.  Enjoy!</p>
    <h2><b>Book I.</b>  Containing as Much of the Birth of the Foundling 
      as Is Necessary or Proper to Acquaint the Reader with in the 
      Beginning of This History</h2>
    <h3><b>Chapter VII.</b>  Containing Such Grave Matter, That the Reader
      Cannot Laugh Once Through the Whole Chapter, Unless Peradventure He 
      Should Laugh at the Author</h3>
    <p>WHEN Jenny appeared, Mr. Allworthy took her into his study, and 
      spoke to her as follows: "You know, child, it is in my power as a 
      magistrate, to punish you very rigorously for what you have done; 
      and you will, perhaps, be the more apt to fear I should execute that 
      power, because you have in a manner laid your sins at my door.</p>
    <p>"But, perhaps, this is one reason which hath determined me to act 
      in a milder manner with you: for, as no private resentment should 
      ever influence a magistrate, I will be so far from considering your 
      having deposited the infant in my house as an aggravation of your 
      offence, that I will suppose, in your favour, this to have proceeded 
      from a natural affection to your child, since you might have some 
      hopes to see it thus better provided for than was in the power of 
      yourself, or its wicked father, to provide for it. I should indeed 
      have been highly offended with you had you exposed the little wretch 
      in the manner of some inhuman mothers, who seem no less to have 
      abandoned their humanity, than to have parted with their chastity. 
      It is the other part of your offence, therefore, upon which I intend 
      to admonish you, I mean the violation of your chastity; -- a crime, 
      however lightly it may be treated by debauched persons, very heinous 
      in itself, and very dreadful in its consequences....</p>
    <h1>Sample text to illustrate HTML elements</h1>
    <p>Here are some HTML elements that should put FOP through its paces.</p>
    <h2>Basic HTML formatting</h2>
    <p><i>Now</i> is the time for all good <b>men and women</b> to come 
      to the aid of <u>the party</u>.  The <tt>quick brown fox</tt> jumped 
      over the <strong>lazy dog</strong>.  Every <em>good boy</em> deserves 
      fudge.  Jackdaws <strike>love</strike> like my big sphinx of quartz.</p>
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>The previous section featured a number of text effects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Bold</b> text</li>
      <li><em>Emphasized</em> text</li>
      <li><i>Italicized</i> text</li>
      <li><strike>Strikethrough</strike> text</li>
      <li><strong>Strongly emphasized</strong> text</li>
      <li><u>Underlined</u> text</li>
      <li><tt>Teletype</tt> text</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here they are again, ranked according to how I like 'em:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><u>Underlined</u> text</li>
      <li><strike>Strikethrough</strike> text</li>
      <li><i>Italicized</i> text</li>
      <li><b>Bold</b> text</li>
      <li><tt>Teletype</tt> text</li>
      <li><em>Emphasized</em> text</li>
      <li><strong>Strongly emphasized</strong> text</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Finally, let's define these things in a definition list, just to 
      have something else to write about.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>Bold</b></dt>
      <dd>Text written in a <b>thicker font</b>.</dd>
      <dt><em>Emphasized</em></dt>
      <dd><em>Emphasized text</em>, usually written in an italicized font.</dd>
      <dt><i>Italic</i></dt>
      <dd>Text written in an <i>italicized font</i>.</dd>
      <dt><strike>Strikethrough</strike></dt>
      <dd>Text with a <strike>line drawn through it</strike>.</dd>
      <dt><strong>Strong</strong></dt>
      <dd><strong>Strongly emphasized</strong> text, usually written in 
        a bold font.</dd>
      <dt><tt>Teletype</tt></dt>
      <dd>Text written in a <tt>monospaced</tt> font.</dd>
      <dt><u>Underlined</u></dt>
      <dd>Text with a <u>line drawn under it</u>.</dd>
      <dd>Here's a second definition of the term, just to test the stylesheet.  
        The second and any subsequent definitions under the same term should 
        appear a half-line below the previous definition.</dd>

    <p>This list uses lowercase Roman numerals starting at 17:</p>

      <li><tt>Teletype</tt> text</li>
      <li><em>Emphasized</em> text</li>
      <li><strong>Strongly emphasized</strong> text</li>

    <p>This one uses lowercase alpha characters and starts at 30:</p>

    <h1>Tables</h1>
    <p>Mapping HTML table tags to XSL-FO tables has some difficulties.  
      The biggest problems are supporting the <code>cols</code> attribute 
      of the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element, and supporting the 
      <code>rowspan</code> and <code>colspan</code> attributes of the 
      <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> element.  Here's a table that illustrates 
      all of the things we support:</p>
    <table cols="200 100pt" border="1">
        <tr>
          <th>State</th>
          <th>Abbr</th>
        </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>North Carolina</td>
        <td>NC</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>California</td>
        <td>CA</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Tennessee</td>
        <td>TN</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td rowspan="2">Texas <br/><i>and</i> <br/>Connecticut</td>
        <td>TX</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>CT</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="right" colspan="2">That's all!</td>
      </tr>

      When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary

      connected them with another, and to assume among the powers 
      of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the 
      Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent
