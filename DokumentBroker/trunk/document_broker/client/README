GENERAL

This folder contains a client library which can be used by the specialized
user systems to implement their communication with the document broker.

The client is written in Python and uses XML-RPC to communicate with the
document broker as well as the template system. It may serve as model for
similar client implementations in other programming languages, such as Java or
C#.

The main sections of the broker_client and template_client files contain simple
test programs. These may be modified to suit the user.
