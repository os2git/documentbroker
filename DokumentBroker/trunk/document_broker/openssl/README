This directory and the files contained therein are part of the Magenta Document
Broker. For licensing, please refer to the COPYING and README files in the root
directory.

This directory will contain scripts and documentation for setting up a CA to
issue and require client side SSL certificates from user systems.

The scripting and general OpenSSL setup is based on the HOWTO guide on this
page:

http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/securitymonkey/howto-securing-a-website-with-client-ssl-certificates-11500

In short, each Document Broker server will implement a Certificate Authority
which will 

a) issue server-side certificates for the broker and template server components
b) issue client-side certificates for user systems and possibly for admin
   users.

All these scripts must be run as the root user. The scripts are, briefly:

* new_ca.sh. This will create a new CA root certificate. WARNING: Should be run
  only once! If rerun, it will generate a new root certificate and invalidate
  all derived certificates.
* new_apache_server.sh. This will generate a new server-side certificate and
  sign it with the CA certificate. Note on usage: Give the server name as
  stated in the Apache configuration's ServerName directive as first parameter.
  Also, the ServerName MUST be entered as the certificate's common_name.
* new_user.sh. TBW.
